# Stanford CS336 Assignments

This repository contains my work and solutions for the assignments in Stanford's CS336 course "Language Modeling from Scratch" (Spring 2025).

## Remarks

- Assignment 1 tokenizer_experiments: The throughput of the tokenizer is estimated to be 485k bytes/second on an Apple M4 Pro chip with 48GB of RAM, using multiprocessing with 14 processes.
